       <p>
		  The sail is so vast when it's laid out on the <br>driveway.
	   </p>  
	   <p>I stake it with a screwdriver through the <br>shackle</p>
		  <p>pulling on the head and <br>clew.</p>
		  <p>Now it's smoothas a night's worth of new <br>snow.</p>
		  <p>My wife, my partner, has been torn from her busy <br>day.</p>
		  <p>We face each other across the sail's <br>foot</p>
		  <p>and with my right hand and her left <br>hand</p>
		  <p>(I'm right handed, she's left <br>handed)</p>
		  <p>we pull an arm's length of the <br>sail</p>
		  <p>down over itself, then do this <br>again,</p>
		  <p>keeping my left hand, and her right hand, towards the <br>foot.</p>
		  <p>Each fold is easier since the sail grows<br> narrower</p>
		  <p>near the top. Then we fold towards each other<br></p>
		  <p>and I wrap my arms around it, while she holds the bag's mouth <br>open,</p>
		  <p>the gray bag that will cover it through the <br>winter.</p>
		  <p>Then I thank her.And the driveway is visible <br>again</p>
		  <p>as it is in spring, when all the snow has <br>melted
		 </p>
