		  The sail is so vast when it's laid out on the <br><div class="one">driveway.</div>
	   </p>  
	   <p>I stake it with a screwdriver through the <br><div class="two">shackle</div></p>
		  <p>pulling on the head and <br><div class="three">clew.</div></p>
		  <p>Now it's smoothas a night's worth of new <br><div class="four">snow.</div></p>
		  <p>My wife, my partner, has been torn from her busy <br><div class="five">day.</div></p>
		  <p>We face each other across the sail's <br><div class ="six">foot</div></p>
		  <p>and with my right hand and her left <br><div class="seven">hand</div></p>
		  <p>(I'm right handed, she's left <br><div class="eight">handed)</div></p>
		  <p>we pull an arm's length of the <br><div class ="nine">sail</div></p>
		  <p>down over itself, then do this <br><div class="ten">again,</div></p>
		  <p>keeping my left hand, and her right hand, towards the <br><div class="oneone">foot.</div></p>
		  <p>Each fold is easier since the sail grows<br><div class ="onetwo"> narrower</div></p>
		  <p>near the top. Then we fold towards each other<br></p>
		  <p>and I wrap my arms around it, while she holds the bag's mouth <br><div class="onethree">open,</div></p>
		  <p>the gray bag that will cover it through the <br><div class="onefour">winter.</div></p>
		  <p>Then I thank her.And the driveway is visible <br><div class="onefive">again</div></p>
		  <p>as it is in spring, when all the snow has <br><div class="onesix">melted</div>
