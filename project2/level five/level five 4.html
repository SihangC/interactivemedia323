		 <a class="one" href=""> The &nbsp;sail<br></a>
		   <a class="two" href="">is so&nbsp; vast<br></a>
		    <a class="three" href="">when it's &nbsp;laid<br></a>
		     <a class="four" href="">out on the driveway.&nbsp;I<br></a>
		      <a class="five" href="">stake it with a screwdriver&nbsp; through<br></a>
		       <a class="six" href="">the shackle pulling on the head&nbsp; and<br></a>
		        <a class="seven" href="">clew.Now it's smoothas a night's worth of &nbsp;new</a>
		        <a class="eight" href=""><br> snow.My wife, my partner, has been torn from&nbsp; her
		        <br></a><a class="nine" href=""> busy day.
		  We face each other across the sail's foot&nbsp;
		  and<br></a><a class="ten" href=""> with my right hand and her left hand
		  (I'm right handed,&nbsp; she's <br></a><a class="oneone" href="">left handed)
		  we pull an arm's length of the sail
		  down over&nbsp; itself,<br></a><a class="onetwo" href=""> then do this again,
		  keeping my left hand, and her right hand, towards &nbsp;the<br></a><a class="onethree" href=""> foot.
		  Each fold is easier since the sail grows narrower
		  near the top.&nbsp; Then<br></a><a class="onefour" href=""> we fold towards each other
		  and I wrap my arms around it, while she holds&nbsp; the<br></a><a class="onefive" href=""> bag's mouth open,
		  the gray bag that will cover it through the winter.
		  Then I thank&nbsp; her. <br></a><a class="onesix" href="">And the driveway is visible again
		  as it is in spring, when all the snow has melted</a>
